#Rockhopper Music Time Series

The **com.rockhoppertech.music.series.time.TimeSeries** class allows you to operate on **Timed** objects independently from **MIDITracks**. The **TimeEvent** class implements **Timed**, and so does MIDINote. You can create **MIDITracks** from **TimeSeries** or extract a **TimeSeries** from a **MIDITrack**.
